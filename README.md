# 🏦 Loan Defaulter Analysis

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset related to loan applicants to identify patterns that could help understand the behavior of loan defaulters. It includes data loading, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and a brief report on insights gained during the process.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Data Handling with Pandas**:
  - Loaded CSV files and explored data with `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()`.
  - Handled missing values, renamed columns, and converted datatypes.
  - Grouped data using `groupby` to compare across categories like credit history, gender, and employment.

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Dealt with missing values in `AMT_ANNUITY	`, `AMT_GOODS_PRICE	`, `OCCUPATION_TYPE	` and many more.
  - Standardized inconsistent entries in categorical fields.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Created charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn:

- **Insights & Reporting**:
  - Learned how to convert raw data into meaningful business insights.
  - Practiced communicating findings with visuals and clear explanations.
